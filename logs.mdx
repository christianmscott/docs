## Basics

Logs provide a real-time view of what is happening inside your application, and can be used to identify issues, monitor performance, and track user activity. Logs that are generated by your application will be collected from your servers and can be viewed in real-time from the Planum dashboard. You can see logs on a component-by-component basis using the logs tab on the application's page in the planum dashbaord.
