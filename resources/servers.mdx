## Basics
Servers represent the physical or cloud-hosted servers, or individual computers, that will run your application workloads. These could be container-based applications, or virtual machine workloads. To join servers to your planum account, just provision a fresh ubuntu server of your chosen version, and [register your server with planum](/registerservers). During registration, an agent is installed on each server which communicates with the planum dashboard, providing telemetry, status information, and command and control for your application workload and system settings. Servers must be joined to a [site](/resources/sites), where they form a local network cluster, sharing the load of your applications, storage, and databases. 

### System Requirements
Servers can be almost any server/compute device which can run linux. Anything from small single board computers, such as a raspberry pi, to racks of blade servers, or even VPS or Cloud-hosted virtual machines may be joined to planum for management and deployment of your application workloads. The currently supported architectures and operating systems include: 

| Operating System | Architecture     |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Ubuntu 22.04     | `amd64`, `arm64` |
| Ubuntu 24.04     | `amd64`, `arm64` |

The agent installation script includes basic setup of pre-requisites such as docker/containerd and service configuration. 

### Network
Servers should be physically connected to some sort of local network, with outbound internet access, and direct network access to the other servers in your site. You may connect servers with wireless connections as well, such as Wi-Fi, cellular, or other radio-based networks. 

## Status
Server status is depicted in the planum dashboard under the servers menu item. Servers have several potential states. 

| Status   | Meaning | Color |
| -------- | ------- | ----- |
| Online  | The server has recently communicated with the planum dashboard   | Green |
| Offline | The server has not been heard from in awhile    | Red |
| Restarting   | The server is rebooting | Green, pulsing |
| Unregistered   | The server has not yet been registered with planum   | Gray |
