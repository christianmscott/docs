## Basics
When you enable public ingress, an ingress gateway is deployed to your site, and your component utilizes that gateway to receive inbound connections. A public URL your-component-slug.planum.dev and TLS certificate will be provisioned automatically. Web requests for 443/80 will be directed to the “exposed port” value you set when enabling public ingress for the component. If your server(s) lose outbound internet connectivity, requests to your application via the public URL will fail with a 5xx status code.
